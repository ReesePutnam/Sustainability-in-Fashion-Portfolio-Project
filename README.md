# My-Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Project


Displayed in the repository is my Sustainability in Fashion data analytics project. This project shows data from 10 different countries and different factors to show how brands from these countries and what sustainable efforts they are using to help the world crisis that comes from clothing production. Each graph in the project displayed is to find out which country has the highest efforts to create a sustainable brand.
